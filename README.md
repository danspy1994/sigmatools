This repository contains tools used for the SIGMA LOOP online radio.

Currently it contains a Xbox 360 MIDI mapping for [MidiHID](http://www.polhosting.info/web-archives/midihid/), a [Mixxx](http://mixxx.org/) MIDI controller that can receive from it, and a work-in-progress direct Mixxx HID scheme for that controller.
It also contains a shell script that adds a nice BGM to any OSX application.
